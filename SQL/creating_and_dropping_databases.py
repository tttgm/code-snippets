### CREATING AND DROPING DATABASES ###

#If you want to use a DATABASE in your application, first you need to CREATE the database and give it a name:

CREATE DATABASE database_name[options]

#If you want to REMOVE a database, use the DROP command:

DROP DATABASE database_name[options]

#To remove a TABLE:

DROP TABLE table_name[options]

#More info about the 'options' can be found in the PostgreSQL docs.
