### Universal Functions in NumPy ###

'''
A 'universal function' (or 'ufunc') is a function that performs elementwise operations on a NumPy array.
They are very fast, 'vectorized' operations.

There are 'unary' ufuncs, which take a single array and return a single array (e.g. .sqrt(arr)),
and there are 'binary' ufuncs, which take 2 arrays and return a single array (e.g. .maximum(arr1, arr2)).
